# S&P500 Stock and Industry Performance Dashboard

## ðŸ“ˆ DS3500 Final Project

##### *Note about the sp500_price.csv.zip file:*
*In order to deploy our dashboard (sp500_main.py), you have to manually unzip the price csv. This is mainly because of Github's inability to support the size of the original file, but it doesn't affect the code or dashboard in any way.*

### ðŸ’¡ Abstract

The S&P 500 is a collection of 500 large-cap company stocks and its price data has historically been used to assess the performance and health of the U.S. market. Given the strong relevance of the S&P 500 but also its complexity and opportunities of nuance in its interpretation, our group aimed to create an interactive dashboard that displays various visualizations of stock data over time to help beginners understand movement and correlations in the market. Our goal is to create a convenient and user-friendly dashboard that gives the user freedom to explore stock performance through different time frames and industries of their choice. In order to implement these features, we used libraries such as Plotly, Dash, and Dash Bootstrap Components. We predicted industries such as Healthcare and Technology to flourish over time, while others like Real Estate may fluctuate with market recessions. Using our dashboard, we were able to draw a multitude of industry-specific conclusions as well as see the impact of global events like COVID-19 on individual stocks over time.


### ðŸ’¸ Project Goals

Smart investors leverage data to maximize the return on their investment. For those just starting out, however, the stock market can be overwhelming and confusing, making it difficult to know where to even start. This often prevents many people, especially students, from beginning their investing journey. We are motivated by the goal of bridging this knowledge gap and making it easy and convenient to learn more about market trends for those with little to no knowledge of the stock market. Our interactive dashboard depicts different features of individual stocks and entire industry sectors from the S&P 500 for comparison over a user-specified window of time. We plan to use the plotly dash library to design our dashboard for user navigation and experience and to style the HTML features with Dash Bootstrap Components. We also intend to incorporate modularity into our project by building a reusable class that will pull stock data from a multitude of csv files.
